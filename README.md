## INSPIRATION

This is an idea I have had rumbling around since May 2024 and the first ComfyUI conference. I poorly assumed someone else would do it long before now. I finally got motivated by [fredconex](https://github.com/fredconex) after the excellent audio synth node work that was done, but was only using presets in the Equalizer.

## HIGHLIGHTS

* Simple right-click menu entry to add or use
* Presets are stored with your other ComfyUI configuration settings
* Easy removal with ctrl-click on entry
